As Head of Documentation and Senior Technical Writer at PSPDFKit, I manage a team responsible for documentation and developer experience. My team documents different software development kits (SDKs) that enable developers to easily integrate powerful document processing solutions into their apps.

Before joining PSPDFKit, I was the Lead Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer at [Adverity](https://www.adverity.com/). I led a team of technical writers who contributed content to the [Adverity documentation site](https://docs.adverity.com/). I maintained the website front end and the underlying software architecture for authoring, publishing, and automation.

Previously, I worked at Tricentis, Omnit, IBM, the Central European University, and the University of Cambridge.

I define myself as an enthusiastic writer, developer, and scholar.

## Writer

Since 2011, I have been working in various roles related to the production and publication of texts. I have extensive experience in writing, editing, vetting, and proofreading documents. I have managed the text production and publication process, as well as the teams involved.

As a technical writer, I primarily see myself as a student and an educator, as someone who learns something new every day and documents this learning experience so that others can learn from it as well. I gather, produce, and disseminate knowledge about complex products, and respond to feedback in order to make the learning experience of readers/users as effective, engaging, and enjoyable as possible.

## Developer

When I started coding in 2018, my main motivation was to improve the user experience on our documentation site. Since then, I have been involved in many different projects, and I have been constantly improving my coding skills. My primary focus is still front-end development in order to make the documentation more user-friendly and engaging, but I have also gained experience in back-end development, automation, and DevOps.

- CSS

- I implemented the front end of the [Adverity documentation site](https://docs.adverity.com/) based on designs received from other departments.

## Scholar

As a scholar, my main fields of interest are memory studies and critical European studies. My primary goal is to uncover certain deeply embedded assumptions and cultural patterns in different discourses about Europe. I am particularly interested in the role of historical narratives in politics, in how visions of the past and the future shape identities and inspire social action.
