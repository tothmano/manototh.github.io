I am the Lead Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer at [Adverity](https://www.adverity.com/) in Vienna. I lead a team of technical writers who contribute content to the [Adverity documentation site](https://docs.adverity.com/). I maintain the website front end and the underlying software architecture for authoring, publishing, and automation.

Previously, I worked at Tricentis, Omnit, IBM, the Central European University, and the University of Cambridge.

I define myself as an enthusiastic writer, developer, and scholar.

## Writer

Since 2011, I have been working in various roles related to the production and publication of texts. I have extensive experience in writing, editing, vetting, and proofreading documents. I have managed the text production and publication process, as well as the teams involved.

As a technical writer, I primarily see myself as a student and an educator, as someone who learns something new every day and documents this learning experience so that others can learn from it as well. I gather, produce, and disseminate knowledge about complex products, and respond to feedback in order to make the learning experience of readers/users as effective, engaging, and enjoyable as possible.

## Developer

When I started coding in 2018, my main motivation was to improve the user experience on our documentation site. Since then, I have been involved in many different projects, and I have been constantly improving my coding skills. My primary focus is still front-end development in order to make the documentation more user-friendly and engaging, but I have also gained experience in back-end development, automation, and DevOps.

I have good working knowledge of the following languages:

- CSS
- HTML
- Groovy
- JavaScript

- TypeScript

## Scholar

As a scholar, my main fields of interest are memory studies and critical European studies. My primary goal is to uncover certain deeply embedded assumptions and cultural patterns in different discourses about Europe. I am particularly interested in the role of historical narratives in politics, in how visions of the past and the future shape identities and inspire social action.
